Table Aggregate
===============

Render a table with aggregated data.

Options:

-------

Given the following configuration:

.. approved:: ../../examples/Command/report-component-table-aggregate
  :language: bash
  :section: 0

When we run PHPBench with the configured report above:


.. approved:: ../../examples/Command/report-component-table-aggregate
  :language: bash
  :section: 1

Then it generates all reports:

.. approved:: ../../examples/Command/report-component-table-aggregate
  :language: bash
  :section: 2
